#TI-graphing calculator-related format HexFiend template[s]
Version 1.0
Template set by LogicalJoe

`TI-flash.tcl` is for OS's and applications (i.e. 8xk, 8xu, 8ek, 8eu)
`TI.tcl` is for non-flash TI files, including backups (i.e. 8xp, 83p, 86d, ect)

This project is primarily meant for `.8x#` files but can read other files,
though functionality is not guaranteed
