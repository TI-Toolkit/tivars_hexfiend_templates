# TI Graphing Calculator-Related Format HexFiend Template[s]
Version 2.0
Template set by LogicalJoe

`TI.tcl` is the main template; it includes all avaliable files as needed.
The `BAZIC/` directory contains files relating to TI-BASIC detokenization.
`TI ROM checksum.tcl` contains algorithms used to verify each of TI's ROMs.

These templates are primarily designed for TI-Z80 calculators:
Files with extensions `.(8[23x56]|73)*` are generally assumed to work.

Files for 68K models (`.89*`, `.9[2x]*`, and `.v2*`) are WIP.

## Installation

HexFiend is avaliable [here](https://github.com/HexFiend/HexFiend).
