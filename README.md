# TI Graphing Calculator-Related Format HexFiend Template[s]
Version 2.0
Template set by LogicalJoe

`TI.tcl` is the main template; it includes all avaliable files as needed.
The `BAZIC/` directory contains files relating to TI-BASIC detokenization.

These templates are primarily designed for TI-Z80 calculators:
Files with the extension `.8[23x56]*` are generally assumed to work.

68K model files (`.89*` and `.9[2x]*`) are WIP.

## Installation
